🎂 Project Title: Gmail + GPT Personalized Birthday Workflow

🧠 Overview

This project automates personalized birthday wishes using AI (GPT), Google Sheets, and Gmail — all orchestrated inside n8n.
Every night at 12:00 AM, the workflow checks whose birthday it is and sends a customized message generated by AI — perfectly tailored for each person’s relationship (e.g., wife, son, friend, etc.).

💡 Problem Solved

Manually remembering and sending heartfelt birthday messages can be time-consuming and inconsistent.
This automation ensures no birthday is ever missed, and every wish feels personal and meaningful — not just a copy-paste template.
